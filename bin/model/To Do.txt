-------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs to fix:
-Size of fastforward and rewind buttons is too big
-Use fixed width font for time
-Error catching in EnterMessageActionListener
-Can't write to pdf

Problems to consider:
-holding focus when typing

-------------------------------------------------------------
Done:
-timestamp with each comment
-fastforward/rewind
-volume control

-Remove comments
	rm (digit) removes that line
	rm removes last
	multiple lines
	allow no space between rm and number
-clear log button
-opening and saving
-save as
