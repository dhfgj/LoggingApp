Features to add:

-key listeners for easy playback control
-volume control
-timestamp when started typing
-fastforward/rewind
-Remove comments
-Output comments to a nice format

Bugs to fix:
-Size of fastforward and rewind buttons is too big
-Reloading while playing causes play/pause button to be backwards - problem since playing and pausing is determined by text
	-add internal boolean instead
-Use fixed width font for time

Problems to consider:
-holding focus when typing


Done:
-timestamp with each comment
