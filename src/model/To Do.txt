Features to add:

-key listeners for easy playback control
-timestamp when started typing
-better fastforward/rewind
-Remove comments
	rm [0-9] removes that line
	rm removes last
-Output comments to a nice format
	-Remove subsequent identical numbers in output 
-html output
-clear log button

Bugs to fix:
-Size of fastforward and rewind buttons is too big
-Use fixed width font for time

Problems to consider:
-holding focus when typing



Done:
-timestamp with each comment
-fastforward/rewind
-volume control
-Output comments to txt
-Reloading while playing causes play/pause button to be backwards - problem since playing and pausing is determined by text
