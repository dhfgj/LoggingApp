Features to add:
Essential:
-error logging system
-help documentation
-make everything synchronized
-make slider actually do something
-save stylings

Good:
-key listeners for easy playback control
-better fastforward/rewind
	-possible ramping
-Output comments to a nice format
	-Remove subsequent identical numbers in output 
	-Remove line numbers
-error handling class
-make gains display in seconds, not milliseconds
-convert timetamps to minute, second
-manual highlighting
-when editing, carriage return automatically add line numbers and whatnot
-make main display box vertically draggable in size
-save playback rate (?)

Extra:
-html output
-error logging system
-add 'menuItem.getAccessibleContext().setAccessibleDescription' to all menu items
-all javadocs added
-notification if incorrect java version (need 8 for JFX) (via installer or something)
-add file types to open audio dialog
-change image on popups
-allow collaboration with multiple people
-default save file name to be the audio file - maybe customizable template
-allow custom hotkeys
	-like live templates
	

Maybe:
-timestamp when started typing (?)

-------------------------------------------------------------
Critical bugs:
-open dialog doesn't allow for selecting files sometimes (after saving)


Bugs:
-Error catching in EnterMessageActionListener
	-Error catching/handling pretty much everywhere actually
-Can't write to pdf or rtf
-on stopping, playpause should change to "play"
	-also when file ends
-gains don't work occasionally (they just don't change)
-txt output doesn't output to multiple lines on Ari's pc
-occasional NaN on time
-progress bar labels move back and forth sometimes
-spacing on display time is wrong
-FileDialogClass has Apple specific stuff

Problems to consider:
-holding focus when typing

-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
Done:
-timestamp with each comment
-fastforward/rewind
-volume control
-Output comments to txt
-Reloading while playing causes play/pause button to be backwards - problem since playing and pausing is determined by text
-Remove comments
	rm (digit) removes that line
	rm removes last
	multiple lines
	allow no space between rm and number
-clear log button
-opening and saving
-save as
-allow volume control before audio file is entered
-file dialog class
-variable playback speed
-re-implement rewind and fastforward
-option to change fastforward and rewind time
-file dialog for open audio
-volume doesn't work
-allow rate to be set before audio file is set
-display current playback rate and rewind/fastforward gain in dialog
-exception class
-playback progress bar
-After clicking 'save' then canceling, 'open' doesn't display properly
-length is NaN (this is possibly a JFX bug)
-Doesn't open _02.wav
	-fixed by using toURI method
-progress bar doesn't work on long files
-when clicking open, then canceling, no audio file is loaded anymore
-filepaths with spaces will break the opening method
-Use fixed width font for time (or make the separator somehow other than raw spaces)
-playback time doesn't reset when making a new file
-open doesn't work anymore
-(possible) regex on opening has changed now that file URIs are different
-when opening, need to add URI stuff
-save (vs save as) doesn't behave as expected
-added highlighting functionality
-wrap text that goes off screen
-Remove "enter path" text box from main screen 
-opening adds additional numbers before each line
-opening doesn't move audio track to saved point
-when opening, change label to reflect startTime of audio
-fast forward gain sets rewind gain instead





-------------------------------------------------------------
Ari's Comments:
mark special comments - highlighting in color?
	highlights different blocks
when playback rate is changed, autotune to correct pitch
