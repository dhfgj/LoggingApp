Features to add:
Essential:
-variable playback speed
-allow volume control before audio file is entered
-error logging system
-help documentation
-make everything synchronized
-notification if incorrect java version

Good:
-key listeners for easy playback control
-better fastforward/rewind
-Output comments to a nice format
	-Remove subsequent identical numbers in output 
-wrap text that goes off screen
-error handling class (exception class)

Extra:
-html output
-error logging system
-add 'menuItem.getAccessibleContext().setAccessibleDescription' to all menu items
-all javadocs added

Maybe:
-timestamp when started typing (?)
-file dialog class?


-------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs to fix:
-Size of fastforward and rewind buttons is too big
-Use fixed width font for time (or make the separator somehow other than raw spaces)
-Error catching in EnterMessageActionListener
	-Error catching/handling pretty much everywhere actually
-Can't write to pdf
-length is NaN
-After clicking 'save' then canceling, 'open' doesn't display properly

Problems to consider:
-holding focus when typing

-------------------------------------------------------------
Done:
-timestamp with each comment
-fastforward/rewind
-volume control
-Output comments to txt
-Reloading while playing causes play/pause button to be backwards - problem since playing and pausing is determined by text
-Remove comments
	rm (digit) removes that line
	rm removes last
	multiple lines
	allow no space between rm and number
-clear log button
-opening and saving
-save as
